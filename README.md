# Gaming-League

** Gaming Campaign League **
This was a project from Codecademy to build a responsive website using CSS.  The key aspect of this webpage is to adapt to resizing to different browsers using Flexbox features and @media queries.

My key takeawaysâ€¦
Apply a reset.css stylesheet before starting.  I think many of my issues were from conflicting browse defaults.  Unfortunately this is one of those things you pick up on your own and was not taught.  It was after the fact that I figured this out and was too late to apply here.

Simplify classes to avoid confusion.

I did have trouble with the body recognizing the increased height of the fixed navbar when resizing.  I added a top margin to the body to account for this, but I know there has to be a better solution out there.
